# Koris

A Lithuanian peer-tutoring platform where students find a tutor, book a lesson, and meet inside a live room with video and a shared whiteboard. Built with Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind v4, and Supabase.

The UI is fully bilingual (English / Lithuanian) and the role layer (`teacher` ↔ `student`) drives what each user can see and do.

## Features

### Auth & profiles
- Email + password sign-up and sign-in (Supabase Auth)
- Google OAuth
- Role-aware profile pages — teachers fill out subjects, hourly rate, bio, weekly availability; students fill out grade, struggles, expectations
- Photo upload to Supabase Storage

### Discover & book
- Browse all tutors with subject and max-price filters
- Tutor detail modal showing subjects, topics, bio, weekly availability grid, and price
- Request a lesson against a tutor's open slots — date, time, subject, optional notes

### Manage lessons
- Tabs for **All / Pending / Accepted / Rejected**
- Teachers accept, reject, or cancel; students track outgoing requests
- Per-lesson detail modal with countdown to start time and a join button that activates 15 min before until 60 min after the scheduled start

### Messaging
- Direct chat between participants of a shared lesson (RLS-enforced)
- Unread badges, list ordered by most recent message, deep-link via `/messages?with=<userId>`
- Lightweight 5 s polling — no realtime channel needed

### Live lesson room (`/lessons/[id]/call`)
- 1-to-1 WebRTC video, signaled through a Supabase Realtime channel — deterministic offerer/answerer roles based on `userId` ordering
- Cameras displayed in a 4:3 side panel; the rest of the screen hosts a collaborative **Excalidraw** whiteboard synced through Supabase broadcast
- Sidebar auto-slides off the left edge when you enter the room and exposes a hamburger toggle so you can pop it back in

### i18n
- Every user-facing string flows through `LanguageProvider`'s `t(key)` helper
- Persisted to `localStorage`; toggle in the topbar

## Getting started

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Supabase

Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```

### 3. Apply the schema

The SQL for `profiles`, `lessons`, `messages`, plus the RLS policies live in [`db/migrations/`](./db/migrations). Run them in order against your Supabase project (e.g. via the SQL editor or `supabase db push`).

### 4. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5. Sign up

Register two accounts — one teacher, one student. Fill out the teacher's profile (subjects + availability + hourly rate), then book a lesson from the student account to try the full flow including the live room.

## How a few pieces work

### `LanguageProvider`
Wraps the tree, persists `lang` to `localStorage`, and exposes `{ lang, setLang, t }`. The `t(key)` helper falls back to English if a key is missing in the active language, then to the raw key — so an unmapped string is loud rather than silent.

### `AppShell`
Client wrapper around `<Sidebar />` plus `{children}`. It watches `usePathname()` and auto-collapses the sidebar on `/lessons/[id]/call` routes. A floating hamburger toggle (top-left) and a close button inside the sidebar let the user override the auto behavior.

### `VideoCall`
Subscribes both peers to `lesson-call:<lessonId>` and uses presence to discover the other party. The peer with the lexicographically smaller `userId` creates the SDP offer; the other answers. SDP and ICE candidates are sent as `signal` broadcasts addressed by `to`. Public Google STUN only — add a TURN server for symmetric-NAT reliability.

### `CollabWhiteboard`
Excalidraw with broadcast-based sync over the same channel pattern. Loaded with `dynamic(() => …, { ssr: false })` because Excalidraw touches `window` at import time.

### Row-level security
Lessons and messages are RLS-protected so a user can only read/write rows where they are a participant. The `messages` insert policy specifically requires that sender and receiver share at least one lesson.

## Notes for contributors

- The Next.js install in this repo is a custom build with breaking changes from the public version. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before touching framework-level code.
- Don't add new hard-coded strings to UI components — extend the dictionary in `src/components/LanguageProvider.jsx` and use `t('your.key')`.
- Profile rows are linked to `auth.users.id` by foreign key, so a profile only exists once a user has registered.
